# Finance-Report
I analyzed the financial data of a SaaS company by comparing real transaction history with the structured budget plan for 2022â€“2024.

ðŸ“„ The report consists of 3 pages:
1. Overview Page â€“ Shows total revenue, expenses, profit/loss, and overall budget variance.
2. Revenue â€“ Detailed view of income by type (SaaS, product, interest), with actual vs. budget comparison.
3. Expensesâ€“ Categorized expenses (e.g., marketing, consulting, insurance), including trends and variances across years.

ðŸ“Š Key Financial Highlights:
Total Revenue: $17.96M vs. Budgeted $16.97M
Total Expenses: $19.41M vs. Budgeted $19.95M
Net Profit/Loss: -$1.45M
